# Enhancing Sustainable Agriculture in South Africa through Data Science
Multi-crop classification in South Africa using Sentinel satellite imagery across multiple spectral bands.

## Project Description:
This project aims to address critical food security challenges in South Africa by leveraging data science techniques, particularly advanced crop classification methods. South Africa faces issues such as crop failures, fluctuating production, and managing imports, which threaten its food security. The primary challenge is to utilize data science tools to enhance food security by improving crop monitoring and accurate crop prediction in South Africa's agricultural sector.

## Objectives:

**1. Enhancing Food Security:** The primary objective of this project is to contribute to enhancing food security in South Africa by leveraging data science techniques to improve crop monitoring and resource allocation in the agricultural sector.

**2. Advanced Crop Classification:** Utilize advanced machine learning models and remote sensing data to develop accurate and robust crop classification algorithms capable of identifying various crop types across different regions in South Africa.

**3. Optimizing Agricultural Practices:** Develop insights and recommendations for optimizing agricultural practices by analyzing vegetation health, land cover classification, and other relevant factors to inform decision-making processes in crop cultivation and resource management.

**4. Sustainability and Resilience:** Promote sustainable agricultural practices and resilience in the face of challenges such as crop failures, fluctuating production, and climate variability, ultimately contributing to the long-term stability of South Africa's food supply.

## Data Sources:

**SENTINEL 2 Satellite Imagery:** The primary data source for this project is satellite imagery obtained from SENTINEL 2 satellites. This imagery provides multispectral data capturing various aspects of the Earth's surface, including vegetation health, moisture content, and land cover classification.
The satellite imagery provides information on various agricultural parameters using remote sensing technology.

## Workflow Execution:

**1. Data Collection:** Obtain satellite imagery data from SENTINEL 2 satellites covering different regions in South Africa. Gather additional geospatial and historical crop data for analysis.

**2. Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the raw satellite imagery data, including handling missing values, deduplicating columns, and removing outliers to ensure data quality and consistency.

**3. Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the satellite imagery data using techniques such as spectral indices calculation, vegetation health assessment, and land cover classification to enhance the predictive power of the models.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of crop types, identify patterns and correlations in the data, and assess the presence of class imbalance or biases that may influence model training and evaluation.

**5. Model Development:** Develop machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, for multi-crop classification using the preprocessed satellite imagery data. Tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance and generalization.

**6. Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the developed models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Compare the performance of different models and identify the most effective approach for crop classification in South Africa.

**7. Results Analysis:** Analyze the results of the model predictions to gain insights into crop distribution patterns, model performance, and areas for improvement. Interpret the findings to inform recommendations for enhancing food security and agricultural practices in South Africa.
